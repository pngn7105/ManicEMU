Manic EMU is an all-in-one retro game emulator for iOS. It brings console,
arcade, computer, and mobile Java systems into one app while keeping a clean,
sleek UI and smooth gameplay-focused controls.

The sections below keep the app details up front, then connect availability,
features, development notes, related documentation, repository layout, and
licensing in one place.

> Manic EMU does not include ROMs, ISOs, BIOS files, or copyrighted game data.
> Use legally owned backups, homebrew, and public-domain software only. See
> the upstream [anti-piracy policy](https://github.com/Manic-EMU/ManicEMU/blob/main/ANTI_PIRACY.md)

## Development Notes

### Runtime

- iPhone or iPad hardware capable of running the selected emulator core.
- Legally obtained game backups and any required system files.
- Optional RetroAchievements account for achievement tracking.
- Optional cloud provider accounts for cloud import and sync workflows.

### Build

- macOS with Xcode 16 or newer.
- iOS SDK 15 or newer.
- Swift 5.9 or newer.
- Git LFS for binary cores and bundled system assets.
- Apple Developer Program account for services such as App Groups,
  In-App Purchases, and iCloud. These capabilities must be configured by the
  builder or removed before compiling.
- Third-party API keys for services configured through `Cipher.swift`, when
  those services are enabled.

### Build Steps

1. Install Git LFS:

   ```sh
   brew install git-lfs
   git lfs install
   ```

2. Clone the upstream Manic EMU repository:

   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Manic-EMU/ManicEMU.git
   ```

3. Open the Xcode project:

   ```sh
   open ManicEMU/ManicEmu/ManicEmu.xcodeproj
   ```

4. Update the developer team and bundle identifier in the ManicEmu target's
   Signing & Capabilities settings.
5. Wait for Swift Package Manager to finish resolving packages, then run the
   app with `Cmd+R`.

Some cores are integrated as binary frameworks, while most cores are built from
upstream source code without modifications. Upstream core changes are tracked
through the [Daiuno repositories](https://github.com/Daiuno?tab=repositories).
